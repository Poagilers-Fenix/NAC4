<h3>Project Description</h3>

Poá Smart City was built on behalf of weather consulting, trying to improve the users experience. Our team has developed a code that can be loaded onto a microcontroller board to return the necessary information to the <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a> flow controller. This information is published in topics through the <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> protocol, and from there anyone can have access.
