## Project Description

Poá Smart City was built on behalf of weather consulting, trying to improve the users experience. Our team has developed a code that can be loaded onto a microcontroller board to return the necessary information to the <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a> flow controller. This information is published in topics through the <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> protocol, and from there anyone can have access.

## How to
For the Poá Smart City project works correctly, you must have followed the programs and resources:
- [ ] <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a> with the dependencies (node-red-dashboard, node-red-serialport and node-red-node-twitter)
- [ ] com0com configured to receive port information COM3 and send to COM4
- [ ] SimulIDE or Arduino that can connect with <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a>
- [ ] Create twitter account to receive alert coming from <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a>
- OBS: if you are going to use a physical microcontroller board, you will need a temperature sensor, anemometer and light sensor.
